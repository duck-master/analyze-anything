# About

This is a library to analyze arbitrary Python objects.

Files:
* `analyze_anything.py`: the main logic!
* `LICENSE`
* `README.md`
* `__init__.py` (currently empty)
* `.pylintrc`
* `.gitignore`

# Functions

There is one main function `analyze_anything(something)`. It uses a helper function `invert_dict(somedict)`.

# Installation

1. Install Python 3 if you don't have it already.
2. Download the source code using `git clone https://github.com/duck-master/analyze-anything.git`.
3. Run the code to test it! You can also import it in your own code (as `__init__.py` marks it as a module).

# Contributing

Make a pull request. Before submitting your pull request, make sure Pylint is satisfied with your code; I expect nothing less than perfection (which isn't *that* hard if you're diligent about it). Also, make sure that the code actually works.
